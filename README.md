# receipe-app
A simple concept application built with Node.js and PostgresSQL based off of Traversy Media's tutorial

##What is the problem I want to solve?

There are many receipies that I would like to save, but it's easy to get unorganized using the current paper system in place.

##How can this problem be solved using software?

This problem can be solved using software by storing receipies in a database and auto-organizing them. Receipies won't be misplaced, it will be easy to sort through them to find them later.

##Which tools can help me implement the software?

- NodeJS - Set up a server to allow read/write access to a database
- PostgresSQL - Data persistence

##How can I program this soultion so that it is clean and maintainable a year from now?

- Modular code
- Lots of appropriate comments
- Simplified logic
- Document the final app archeticture visually for easy reference
- Document each endpoint, what information it takes, error codes, and expected responses
- Document example queries
